***Abstract<br/> 
With more than 2 billion active users [10], YouTube is the largest 
video sharing social media platform which currently not only helping 
sharing videos but also has become a large source of finance as well. But as the user
increased the spam videos [9], [4] also increased which
doesnâ€™t help neither the user nor the honest creator of
videos of that domain.
In this paper, we have performed and listed our observation
based on reviewing several papers both conference and
journal papers from IEEE, ACM, Springer Link and
retrieve papers from Google Scholar and identified several
research questions along with suggestive solutions. We have
reviewed papers on different aspects including solution
given comment based [2], content based, like dislike based
video relevance. We have also tried to identify the datasets
been used on those papers along with the used data science
models and how those models and algorithms responded
with the selected datasets. Our emphasis been given on a
slight different domain, mostly how the algorithm and
models can be used and improved for novice music video
uploaders when an user try to find a new artist with new or
unplugged music videos.***
